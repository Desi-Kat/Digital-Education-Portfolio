I project managed the design and development of this interactive online course for an external client (Thames Valley Police). The project was a huge success and ended up being endorsed by celebrity hairdresser [Nicky Clarke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS8Ao1O1QOI).
The launch had wide press coverage and it appeared on Sky News, TES Magazine, and [MK Citizen](https://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/news/crime/new-domestic-abuse-prevention-campaign-developed-in-milton-keynes-launched-with-famous-hairdresser-3207546). The project made an impact within the college and industry and other college students and industry professionals access it and has resulted in 2000 page views in the first three months of its launch.
